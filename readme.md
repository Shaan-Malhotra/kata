Write a FizzBuzz function that satisifies the following requirements: 

- Write a function that counts from 1 to n and returns a list of numbers which have FizzBuzzed.
- If a passed a number, print the number.
    - fizzBuzz(1) > 1
    - fizzBuzz(2) > 2
    - fizzBuzz(13) > 13
- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    - fizzBuzz(3) > "Fizz"
                                   
- If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
    - fizzBuzz(3) > "Fizz"
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
    - fizzBuzz(15) > "FizzBuzz"



example:

fizzBuzzCounter(5);

> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz
